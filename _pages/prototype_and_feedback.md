### Prototype Report

Our team is designing a sustainable process, called Data Governance Health Status Checks, that will promote continuous updating of data inventories. Due to receiving new information from the Data Services Team after we submitted our Implementation Plan, we made some last-minute changes to make sure we addressed the city&rsquo;s information needs. Our original plan was to document procedures for both the Data Services Team and the data coordinators, however, some of the procedures that we outlined in our storyboard became obsolete with the new information we received from our partner. Our prototype still includes documentation for both the Data Services Team and data coordinators, but it focuses more on the procedures to be carried out by the Data Services Team. Ultimately, this will benefit managers of all departments, because the Data Services Team will be in a better place to support them in maintaining their data and data inventories.  There are three major components to our product: Health Status Checks Procedures, Tracking and Summary Tables, and Critical Records Program.

**Health Status Checks Procedures**

This component consists of the procedural documentation surrounding Health Status Checks. 
* Data Coordinator Procedures provides data coordinators with basic instructions for completing the data inventory and submitting the data inventory and datasets ready for publication to the Data Services Team.
* Prioritizing Data Publication provides guidance for selecting datasets for publication based on several features including how useful or popular the dataset is.
* Data Services Procedures provides the Data Services Team with instructions for creating and maintaining various tables that we designed for the Health Status Checks and a newsletter, which will be the primary reference document used in Data Governance Health Status Checks meetings.
* Health Status Checks Newsletter Template provides an outline for the Data Services Team to report progress to departments and other stakeholders.

**Tracking and Summary Tables**

This component consists of a set of tables in Excel that will allow the Data Services Team to keep track of milestones for each department, such as whether the department has scheduled or completed a Needs Assessment, has completed their data inventory and data catalog, and has identified a data coordinator and data stewards. All of these data points ultimately allow the Data Services Team to track which departments are compliant with the ODO and take action to assist noncompliant departments in becoming compliant. This component also consists of a user guide with detailed instructions for entering data into the tracking table and understanding the summary tables, which update automatically when the tracking data is updated. 

**Critical Records Program**

This component is a small visual basic application in Excel that searches data inventory files for datasets that are due to be updated, that should be open but are not yet open, and/or that have errors in fields used to identify these problems. The program creates a report that classifies these problems into one of three criticality levels&ndash;Mission Critical, Vital, or Important, which are displayed in separate sheets in the report. This report will promote continuous updating of data inventories by highlighting datasets that need to be reviewed for updates or that have other problems that could result in data loss. This component also consists of a user guide with detailed instructions for running the program and copying data into the Newsletter.

### Audience and Testing

There are two audiences for this product: 1) the Department of Innovation and Performance, specifically, the Data Services Team, who oversee the city&rsquo;s efforts to publish open data, and 2) the data coordinators from each city department who maintain data inventories and publish their department&rsquo;s data. The following table explains the audience and the testing we will conduct for each of the deliverables in this product.

**Data Services Procedures.docx**<br/>
***Audience*** Data Services Team

_Usability Testing_: Members of the Data Services Team will carry out the steps in the procedures and provide feedback about their experiences. We are specifically looking to find out if they need help performing any steps or if they have questions about the process while they are going through it. Their feedback will help us to improve the document by clarifying or adding information.

**Health Status Checks Newsletter Template.pptx**<br/>
***Audience*** Data Services Team and data coordinators

_Design Critique_: Members of the Data Services Team and two to four Data Coordinators will review the design of the newsletter and provide feedback about what aspects of the design meet their needs and which aspects need some improvement. We are specifically looking to find out how the layout and content of the newsletter contribute to its feasibility and usefulness.

**Data Coordinator Procedures.docx**<br/>
***Audience*** Data coordinators

_Usability Testing_: Two to four Data Coordinators from different departments will carry out the steps in the procedures and provide feedback about their experiences. We are specifically looking to find out if they need help performing any steps or if they have questions about the process while they are going through it. Their feedback will help us to improve the document by clarifying or adding information.

**Prioritizing Data Publication.docx**<br/>
***Audience*** Data Services Team and data coordinators

_Design Critique_: Members of the Data Services Team will review the guidelines for prioritizing data publication and provide feedback about whether the guidelines match their expectations for how departments should prioritize data publication. After incorporating comments from the Data Services Team, two to four Data Coordinators will review the guidelines for coherence and clarity.

**User Guide: Tracking and Summary Tables.docx**<br/>
***Audience*** Data Services Team

_Usability Testing_: Members of the Data Services Team will review the user guide for the Tracking and Summary Tables process, carry out the steps to update the Data table, and provide feedback about their experiences. We are specifically looking to find out if the User Guide is clear about which tables they are supposed to maintain and which tables get copied to the newsletter. Their feedback will help us to improve the document by clarifying or adding information.

**Tracking and Summary Tables.xlsx**<br/>
***Audience*** Data Services Team

_Focus Group_: Members of the Data Services Team will review the summary tables and discuss the indicators. We are specifically looking to find out if the indicators meet their needs for monitoring the open data process or if they would like to modify, remove, or add any. We also need to verify which fields are used to determine compliance with the ODO.

**User Guide: Critical Records Program.docx**<br/>
***Audience*** Data Services Team

_Usability Testing_: Members of the Data Services Team will review the user guide for the Critical Records Program, carry out the steps to prepare and run the macro, and provide feedback about their experiences. We are specifically looking to find out if the user guide is clear about how to change the paths to the source and target folders and how to run the program. Their feedback will help us to improve the document by clarifying or adding information.

**Critical Records Program**<br/>
***Audience*** Data Services Team

_Focus Group_: Members of the Data Services Team will review the summary tables and discuss the types of problems caught by the program and the distribution of those problems into the three levels of criticality. We are specifically looking to find out if the program will address their concerns about losing track of datasets in the data inventories. Their feedback will help us to improve the program by modifying its problem and/or levels of criticality definitions.
